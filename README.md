# CodeSmells

In a group of work and within the Software Engineering course unit, we developed a program that would analyse any java project chosen, and would generate an Excel file containing some important code smells. The user could load any project that he wanted, and chose some aditional code smells to be present in the generated .xlsx file. The main part of this project was to make us learn how to work as a team and use tools like git, as well as repositories in Maven during its development.
